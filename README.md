writing senryu poetry, \this is perhaps a program which can delivery senryu or haikai assemblages of the 5 syllable, 7 syllable and 5 syllable poems in answer to questions or problems posed.  This may require some kind of semantic ontology or natural language processing to find relevant poetry with which to respond or to generate a request for poetry to be written regarding inquiry.  So in other words I am not sure what this does.  Will apparently need a resource of poems with which to work.
